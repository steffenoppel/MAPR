REVISION NOTES

- implemented a GoF test in CJS model
- read in AHM book that posterior predictive check can only work on aggregate measures, not on single cell values
- need to run CJS model in m-array for proper GoF test

- DIC is a very confusing measure and pD, the number of effective parameters is highly variable
- for prediction AIC is recommended, hence I extracted the number of parameters and calculated AIC by hand from deviance
